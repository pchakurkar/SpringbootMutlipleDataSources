# SpringbootMutlipleDataSources
This repo includes a sample code demonstrating the usage of 2 different data sources and how the transactions to these data sources can be made atomic using @Transactional annotation. This is sort of a POC to verify that we can talk to multiple user DBs in our case and rollback the transactions, if needed.
